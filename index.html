		<h1> This is <strong>MY</strong> motherfucking website!!</h1>
		<p>And it is the best one ever!</p>
	</header>

	<h2>Seriously, how can it be better?</h2>

	<p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://www.thefuckingwebsite.top" target="_blank">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website</p>

	<!--I steal the long text because I'm french and it take me ages to invent stuff in english :D -->

	<ul>

        <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
        <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
        <li>The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
        <li>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Well guess what looser:</h3>

	<p>YOU ARE OVER-DESIGNING !!! Look at my fucking website! It's a motherfucking website. Why the fuck do you need to animate a fucking trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some motherfucker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.</p>

	<p>It is a big news for you but it the best think for you dumb ass! and this is why:</p>

	<h2><strong>IT IS RESPONSIVE</strong></h2>

	<p>CSS slow down so much your website so stop using it and sell your fucking MAC, go to a charity shop and by all your computers there! It is fucking better for the planet!!!</p>

	<h2>It fucking work! and it work well!</h2>

	<p>ook at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.</p>

	<p>It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
	<p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you.</p>

	<h2>And seriously have you ever seen a website like this one before?</h2>

	<p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</p>

	<h3>Yes, of course this is fucking satire, espèce de crétin.</h3>
<!--un peu de français ça marque toujours le coup -->

	<p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>
