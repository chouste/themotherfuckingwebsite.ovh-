		<h1> This is <em>MY BEST</em> motherfucking website!!</h1>
		<p>And it is the best one ever!</p>
	</header>

	<h2>Seriously, how can it be better? like this isn't it?</h2>

	<p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://www.thefuckingwebsite.top" target="_blank">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>

	<p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class="green">thefuckingwebsite.top</span> is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>

	<p><span class="red"><strong><em>WRONG</em></strong></span>, motherfucker.</p>

	<!--I steal the long text because I'm french and it take me ages to invent stuff in english :D -->
	<h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>

	<ul>

        <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
        <li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the<a href="http://google.fr">Google home page</a>.</li>
        <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
        <li>Looks almost the same on every screen.</li>
        <li>The motherfucker's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" title="W3C" target="_blank">accessible</a> to every asshole that visits your site <span class="petit">but not everyone can read this hahaha.</span></li>
        <li>Shit is even more legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank">ARPANET</a> website.</li>
        <li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers" target="_blank"> IPoAC</a><./li>
        <li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans" <span class="petit"> which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf.</span></li>
        <li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
        <li>Doesn't include any tracking service this website does,<span class="petit"> but hey, who cares.</span></li>
        <li>use some fucking <span class="biz"></span> colors.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Well guess what looser:</h3>

	<p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>


	<h2>Let it breath</h2>

	<p>CSS slow down so much your website so stop using it and sell your fucking MAC, go to a charity shop and by all your computers there! It is fucking better for the planet!!!</p>

	<h2>It fucking work! and it work well!</h2>

	<p>ook at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.</p>

	<p>It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
	<p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you.</p>

	<h2>And seriously have you ever seen a website like this one before?</h2>

	<p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</p>

	<h3>Yes, of course this is fucking satire, espèce de crétin.</h3>
<!--un peu de français ça marque toujours le coup -->

	<p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>

	<p>"Good design is as little design as possible" <br />
